    "answer": "Nancy Pelosi and Heidi Hardin\nThink Round, Inc. is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization founded in July of 2004 by Heidi Hardin. Heidi is a fine artist whose experience as an original member of San Francisco’s Hunters Point Shipyard artists’ community and as an arts educator working with children in the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood shaped her vision of creating art that tells a multifaceted story of family, faith, community and culture. Since 1992, Heidi and the artists she recruited, as well as the teachers and principals where they taught have created and implemented art-based programs for children, youth and their families designed to improve life in the traditionally underserved Southeast Sector of San Francisco. Think Round, Inc.’s programming reflects the same core concerns that guide our artists and their artwork, that include environmental awareness, universal spirituality, and the power of creativity to transform people’s lives.\nMISSION STATEMENT\nThe mission of Think Round, Inc. is to demonstrate life's fullest potential through the arts and sciences, especially where environmental concerns meet family homes and neighborhoods. Our programs and art installations explore ideas about cultural self-definition, the pervasiveness of the American dream, and the universality of the human family. These artworks will be permanently housed at The Center for the Human Family, which is in planning as a destination for families, where they will go -- physically or virtually over the world wide web -- not to be entertained, but to have an authentic experience of being human, of being a member of the Human Family. In addition, this center will provide facilities for individuals and groups, families and foes, to study world religions, human spiritual evolution, consciousness, and creativity. The Center for the Human Family will also provide programs for conflict resolution, individual and family healing, and other programs that will help establish happy, healthy, and sustainable living on the planet.",

    "question": "What does Think Round Inc. say about Paradise Project?",
    "answer": "The Center for the Human Family is conceived as a state-of-the-art museum centered on Think Round’s message: Earth is home. Humans are family. Through the arts and sciences, The Center will explore issues of family, faith, ethnicity, culture, and diversity, while sharing cutting-edge knowledge about human health and the health of our planet, Earth. Creative ownership of The Center will be given to children, youth, and their families through enrichment programs Think Round offers in schools and on the world wide web that produce high-end permanent public artworks.\nDuring the pandemic Think Round designers have devoted their time to envisioning The Center for the Human Family. The renderings here are a glimpse into TRI’s twin visions: completing The Paradise Project and building The Center for the Human Family to house it. Take a look and imagine with us all that The Center can become.\nA destination…for families, about families, created by families\nThe inspiration…“It is my belief that the peoples of the earth live within webs of cultural and social forces, much as stars and planets exist within webs of natural forces that both bind them together and keep them apart. Though we seem to live as separate individuals, nations, cultures, and faiths, in truth we are one in our humanity.” —Heidi Hardin\nThe Center for the Human Family is in planning as a destination for families, where they will go--physically, or virtually over the world wide web--not to be entertained (like at Disneyland), but to have an authentic experience of being human, of being a member of the human family. The Center for the Human Family will provide facilities for individuals and groups, families and foes, to study world religions, human spiritual evolution, consciousness, and creativity. The Center will also provide programs for social and political conflict resolution; personal and family healing, as well as arts programs that will help establish happy, healthy, and sustainable living on the planet.\nCurrently, The Center is envisioned as a three-story geodesic dome—a design provided as a pro bono gift from Grey and Grey Architects. Thank you, Leland Grey.\nOutdoors, we envision educational, hands-on activities related to healthy, sustainable living on the planet. We will feature urban aquaponic and vertical gardens and a variety of farms for fish and domesticated animals. These sustainable organic food sources will be cultivated for use by our Culinary Academy students and faculty utilizing best practices called for by the “Greenest Big City” in America, San Francisco.\nIndoors we envision interactive, calm, educational, cultural exhibitions and services to be offered at no-or-low cost to local communities, and over the internet to families from around the world. On the first floor, there will be a culinary school and workshop for children celebrating the PLANTS, ANIMALS, and PEOPLE of the world. The kitchens at The Center in our waterfront restaurant will feature foods from seven continents of the world with interactive, innovative exchanges between peoples of the world as you dine.\nThe second floor will provide gallery spaces for an ever-growing number of Bay Area artists, with access virtually for artists from around the world. There will be a community conference space and a separate auditorium for meetings, presentations, storytelling, poetry slams and readings, webinars, and more. Additionally, the second floor of The Center will provide recovery rooms especially focused on healing and preventing childhood trauma. TRI’s trauma incident reduction programs span the life of a family from prenatal care through retirement and are known as Think Round’s Whole Systems Learning Curricula. Created by Think Round and our partners, the Magic of Why©, the Ardicare Foundation, and STAR, Shipyard Trust for the Arts, these programs will be free, non-medical, non-diagnosing, non-religious, and confidential.\nThe third floor will house an interactive exhibition titled, The Human Family Tree/A Walk Through Paradise…seven installations, otherwise known as The Paradise Project. The Paradise Project presents 546 portraits of 28 families of different ethnicities who are practicing ten of the major world religions. This novel form of storytelling will provide an outlet for everyone in the world to add their own family’s story to it. In this way, The Center will be a destination—in person or virtually—for families, about families, created by families.\nThe Center for the Human Family and its sister project Paradise Project, rely on the help of donors, philanthropist organizations, and local tech companies that can help with the complex technical aspects of this project.\nPlease visit our upcoming page showcasing the ways each individual or institution can contribute to these projects.\nThe Center provides many facilities that aim to democratize local and global public access to the art and science of Earth as our home, and humans as family, thus spreading cultural and artistic ideas.\nThe Auditorium serves the people of the Bay Area at no-or-low cost to hold their talks and presentation. The Conference Room serves our students for environmental science education and trauma incident reduction.\nFree mental health access\nThe world in a near future is a mental health conscious one. Center for the Human Family endeavors to bring free therapy sessions particularly focusing on ACEs (adverse childhood experiences)\nAquaponic Fish Farm & Vertical Gardens\nThe vertical garden and aquaponic fish farm complex are the first of their kind in teaching children about the importance of such things as food supplies and home gardens.\nCulinary Academy\nKnowledgeable children understand food as fuel and its impact on their health across a lifetime.\nAir, Water, and Soil Exhibit\nAN exhibit to engage the audience with the main elements that create life on the planet everyday.\nFood from seven continents\nThe Center for the Human Family will house a restaurant that will offer foods that come from the in-house vertical gardens, as well as the fish and family farms housed there. The Culinary Academy at The Center will specialize in teaching children the essential skills of how to grow, harvest, prepare, and cook food.\nEnergy Efficient Building\nCenter for The Human family will be at the forefront of sustainable buildings.\nA destination…\nfor artists\nby artists\nThe Center will provide young, thriving Bay Area artists with a space to exhibit their artworks and kickstart their careers, as well as, space for acclaimed eco-artists and their artworks on the leading edge of thought about the needs of the planet.\n2nd Floor will house big spaces for simultaneous exhibits of the artworks of young, thriving Bay Area artists, as well as established eco-artists on the leading edge of thought about the needs of our planet.\nThe second-floor exhibitions about AIR, WATER, SOIL...will be explorable in immersive, interactive, touch-free exhibitions.\nThe seven installations of the Human Family Tree/A Walk Through Paradise... (The Paradise Project) are envisioned to be the great attractor or centerpiece of The Center for the Human Family. High overhead, an expansive stained-glass window depicting the human walk out of Africa onto the seven continents of the world will fill the dome with the journey of the human family. Down the walls of the dome, frescos and changing digital displays that depict the flora and fauna of the seven continents will flow… landing on immersive displays of the art history of the ten major world religions.\nHolographic Earth with cross section showing interactions of the core, mantel, crust, & magnetic field whose lines divide the room into the seven installations of the Paradise Project\nLaid out as a labyrinth as large as a football field on the third floor, each of the seven \"houses\" of The Paradise Project will celebrate the ethnic, cultural, and spiritual heritage of 28 families practicing ten of the world’s major religions as seen through the life stories of Hardin’s subjects.\nTaken together, The Paradise Project is envisioned to be an artistic, interactive story-telling project of the human family conceived to raise humanity’s consciousness of the continuity of our existence back into deep time. The featured stories of individual families of different origins, cultures, and faiths aim to connect those stories to the planet earth, as well as the sacred nature of the origins and essence of all life here.\nOver the coming decades, new families of different backgrounds from everywhere in the world will be provided a digital space to artistically tell the stories of their own families in unique, engaging, informative ways. For more information regarding the current state of the Paradise Project and how to participate, please contact info@thinkround.org.\nThe newly designed armatures reduces distractions while increasing the immersive experience of the portraits, touching objects, environmental displays, and sound tracks.\nThink Round’s creative team has been redesigning the armatures that hold the numerous portraits to maximize the values held within the scores of touching objects surrounding the painting. Conceived as object portraits and talismans, these heavily curated objects invite, perhaps induce, visitors to the labyrinth to engage directly with them to glean vibrational energies of personals, historical, cultural, and holy items of interest.\nParadise Project will be a new standard for the way interactive exhibitions are done. Bay Area has always been a cradle for new ideas and new technologies. It deserves to house one of the most immersive interactive exhibitions in the country.\nStained glass ceiling: Humans walk out of Africa onto the seven continents of the world.\nWalls of the dome: Flora & fauna of the seven continents along with touch-free, changing displays of the art history from each faith\nVisitors will see the many portraits of our subject families and be able to listen to the 36 original soundtracks by L.A. composer, Jonathan Sacks created for each path and each station.\n1st Floor: Culinary Academy Kitchens, Waterfront Restaurant,\nThe Center for the Human Family will house a restaurant that will offer foods that come from the in-house vertical gardens, as well as the fish and family farms housed there. The Culinary Academy at The Center will specialize in teaching children the essential skills of how to grow, harvest, prepare, and cook food.\nIn Think Round’s ongoing, award-winning environmental science enrichment programs, The Children’s Mural Program and The Kid’s Environmental Education Program, KEEP! our students learn this simple message: when the air, water, and soil are happy and healthy, so will be the plants, animals, and people. In this way, our culinary program participants will gain hands-on experience with and the deeper importance of sustainable food sources, cooking, and the link of foods they eat to the health of their bodies.\nIn the face of the global climate crisis—with floods, droughts, fires, acidifying oceans—food and water scarcity will become common knowledge for our students. And our students will learn how to respond and have the ability to respond to the need to protect and care for our precious natural resources: air, water, and soil. They will be responsible, loving, nurturing stewards of the planet’s oceans, rivers and streams, watersheds, farmlands, habitats of indigenous plants and animals, and more—all the ecosystems that sustain us.\nThe balcony area will provide a space for people to relax and have fun on a nice sunny day.\nThe balcony will have two strategically accessible entrances to the main gallery areas that provide natural airflow on the second floor\nThe balcony will provide a space showcasing vertical farming, solar energy panels. and more\nImagine with us all that The Center for the Human Family can become.

It draws from Think Round’s body of work empowering children, youth, and families through art-making and education.\nA permanent home for Paradise… and for the related experiential programming that advances Think Round, Inc.’s ongoing commitment to education is The Center for the Human Family. The current manifestation of The Center for the Human Family is a fine arts gallery called Think Round Fine Arts where artists who champion the values of Think Round, Inc. show and discuss their work.\nGOALS AND OBJECTIVES\nBy year-end 2016, 16 family art-making gatherings will be held in the community, one original music score and 40 new paintings and will be added to Paradise…, for a total of 196 paintings representing 36% of the total project and three of seven planned sound environments.\nBy year-end 2016, one temporary exhibition of Paradise… will be held in San Francisco, and 10 artist exhibitions with associated interactive gatherings with artists, plus one exhibition of Family Made Art will be held at Think Round Fine Arts as the next steps toward realizing The Center for the Human Family vision.\nOUR CURRENT AND FUTURE PROJECTS\nTHINK ROUND FINE ARTS\nThink Round Fine Arts (formerly Hardin Studios) opened in October 2012 in the upper Fillmore district of San Francisco.

HUMANS ARE FAMILY.”\n·        Inclusiveness & Celebration – Human Family Tree/A Walk Through Paradise…Seven multi-media installations designed to spiritualize the human body & all human cultures\n·        Health & Wellness – Conflict resolution, family healing & neighborhood safety\n·        Sustainability – Community participation in global living\nThink Round, Inc. is a non-profit created in 2004 to expand the award-winning community benefits programs and public art projects nurtured by artist Heidi Hardin, scores of San Francisco artists, public school administrators and teachers, thousands of children and their families, as well as innovative partners in local state and federal government agencies. Think Round’s programming has been offered for over twenty years for San Franciscans in general, and for the residents in the impact zone of Hunters Point Shipyard (HPS) including Bayview Hunters Point, Visitation Valley, and Potrero Hill in particular.  Working with city and federal agencies, public schools, community groups, and artists Think Round has created enrichment programs that have taken a leap forward—giving voice and active roles to residents in the physical enhancements of the Southeast Sector of San Francisco (SF) and providing youth with hope for vital, happy, healthy and productive futures at this time of community revitalization. The most recent of these enhancements is the signature artwork for Hunters Point Shipyard’s (HPS) Hill Point Park Stream of Consciousness, commissioned by the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency, HPS Project as part of the Cultural Historic Recognition Program, following a national call for proposals. The stream was installed at HPS's new Hillpoint Park in the January of 2016.\nCurrently the focus of Think Round, Inc. is the completion of the Human Family Tree Project and the development of Think Round Fine Arts, and the creation of the Center for the Human Family. To do this, we are expanding our outreach to all San Franciscans, young and old, interested in supporting our guiding belief for these projects: “Earth is home. Humans are family.”\nThink Round, Inc. does not and shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion (creed), gender, gender expression, age, national origin (ancestry), disability, marital status, sexual orientation, or military status, in any of its activities or operations.

Family art-making classes led by high school teens will accompany this exhibit allowing youth and families to share and learn from each other subjects that range from world religions and myths, human evolution, migration, genetics, and astronomy. Family talks will allow the community to explore their personal questions about Islam and for Islamic families to express their interests in and desires for diversity, inclusiveness, and the tapestry of America’s social landscape.\n·        2018 will culminate in October (through December) with an exhibition featuring four families of different ethnicities practicing the Jewish faith titled, Families in Paradise. Our goal with the completion of this installation is to simultaneously exhibit all three installations of the Human Family Tree Project: the Christians, the Jews, and the Muslims – otherwise known as The Family of Abraham. Panel discussions are in planning to identify key intractable social and political positions that keep the planet in peril and its people under constant stress. We will be seeking solutions to raise awareness of and to heal the broken heartstrings within the Family of Abraham that put our planet and all our lives at risk.\nOUR OBJECTIVES (2004-2014)\n·        Provide an outreach mechanism for all participants in the Hunters Point Shipyard (HPS) cleanup and reuse process.\n·        Provide programs in particular, for 94124, 94134, and 94107 schools, cultural centers, and senior centers that teach the art and science of the cleanup and redevelopment of HPS as well as for those residents in the Bay Area who interested or affected.\n·        Produce outcomes--especially public artworks--that give creative input and ownership of their community to residents of SF's Southeast sector in particular, while creating opportunities for residents in the broader Bay Area to create similar projects for their neighborhoods.\n·        Produce creative outlets for exploring family creativity, human spiritual evolution, conflict resolution at home and across borders, as well as sustainable living on the planet.\nOUR PROGRAMS-AVAILABLE \"ON DEMAND\"\nIn 2011, the Children's Mural Program, an environmental science program using art as its teaching modality, completed its 20th successful year in Bayview Hunters Point Elementary Schools, bringing art and science education to more than 5,000 children in five community elementary schools.  Our focus:\n·         Art – Creating paintings, murals, ceramic tiles & other public art projects about Earth and Family\n·         Environmental Education –Teaching science and reuse of Hunters Point Shipyard & other Bay Areas\n·         Health – Promoting exercise & good nutrition for youth and families for “Fitness for Life”\nOther Think Round, Inc. programs include:\nProviding field trips into natural habitats of Bayview Hunters Point (BVHP) like Hunter Point Shipyard and Herons Head Park for hands-on experience with “air, water, and soil”.
