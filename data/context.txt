# HISTORY AND VALUES

Think Round, Inc. is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization founded in July 2004 by artist and educator Heidi Hardin. Her work in San Francisco’s Hunters Point Shipyard and Bayview Hunters Point inspired a vision of art that reflects family, faith, community, and culture.

Since 1992, Think Round has led arts-based programs for children, youth, and families to improve life in traditionally underserved neighborhoods.

Think Round’s core values include environmental awareness, universal spirituality, and the power of creativity to transform lives.

# MISSION STATEMENT

The mission of Think Round, Inc. is to demonstrate life’s fullest potential through the arts and sciences — especially where environmental concerns meet family homes and neighborhoods.

Its programs explore cultural self-definition, the American dream, and the universality of the human family. These works will be permanently housed at The Center for the Human Family.

The Center will be a global destination for authentic human experience, study of spirituality and consciousness, and tools for healing, sustainability, and peace.

# CODE OF ETHICS

Think Round’s true code of ethics: “Earth is home. Humans are family.”

# FLAGSHIP PROGRAM: THE HUMAN FAMILY TREE / A WALK THROUGH PARADISE

This evolving multimedia art installation uses paintings and original music to honor cultural commonalities across diverse beliefs and ethnicities.

“Paradise” is rooted in Think Round’s direct experience in San Francisco’s Southeast Sector and embodies its mission through art and education.

# THINK ROUND FINE ARTS

Launched in 2012, Think Round Fine Arts (formerly Hardin Studios) is a nonprofit gallery that exhibits work by students, families, and teachers from Think Round programs.
