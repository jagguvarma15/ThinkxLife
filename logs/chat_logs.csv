Their mission is to demonstrate life's fullest potential through the arts and sciences, especially where environmental concerns meet family homes and neighborhoods. Think Round offers arts-based programs for children, youth, and families in traditionally underserved neighborhoods, with a focus on environmental awareness, universal spirituality, and the power of creativity to transform lives. Their programs explore cultural self-definition, the American dream, and the universality of the human family."
